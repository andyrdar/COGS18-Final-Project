# COGS18-Final-Project
For my final project examination I analyzed electroencephalogram recordings (EEG) of a macaque monkey, sampling from one array out of a session from the whole experiment. The dataset is from Chen et al. and can be found at: https://gin.g-node.org/NIN/V1_V4_1024_electrode_resting_state_data

For the purposes of time efficacy, I uploaded the file I used for the script to a shared Google Drive linked below. If Drive is conected to the User's computer terminal, the scrip should be able to run without any needs of modification. If not, and the user decided to download the file, the variable PATH inside the python script should be changed into that of the current directory.

I used packages learnt in class like Numpy and Pandas as well as packages from Voytek's Lab at UCSD (specifically FOOOF and Neurodsp).
