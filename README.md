# COGS18-Final-Project
For my final project examination I analyzed electroencephalogram recordings (EEG) of a macaque monkey, sampling from one array out of a session from the whole experiment. The dataset is from Chen et al. and can be found at: https://gin.g-node.org/NIN/V1_V4_1024_electrode_resting_state_data

For the purposes of time efficacy, I uploaded the file I used for the script to this repository so that the Notebook can be run from any computer.

I used packages learnt in class like Numpy and Pandas as well as packages from Voytek's Lab at UCSD (specifically FOOOF and Neurodsp).
